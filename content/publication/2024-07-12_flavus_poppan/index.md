abstract: "*Aspergillus flavus* is a clinically and agriculturally important saprotrophic fungus responsible for severe human infections and extensive crop losses. Here, we analyze genomic data from 300 (117 clinical and 183 environmental) *A. flavus* isolates from 13 countries, including 82 clinical isolates sequenced in this study, to examine population and pan-genome structure and their relationship to pathogenicity. We use single nucleotide polymorphisms to build a phylogeny, analyze admixture, and perform discriminant analysis of principal components. We identify five *A. flavus* populations, including a new population, D, corresponding to distinct clades in the genome-wide phylogeny. Strikingly, > 75% of clinical isolates were in population D and <5% in population B. We also use orthogroup clustering to identify core and accessory genes within the pan-genome. Accessory genes, including genes within biosynthetic gene clusters, were significantly more common in some populations but rare in others. Our functional annotations show that population D is enriched for genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism and certain types of hydrolase activity, whereas a non-clinical population is depleted in genes related to zinc ion binding. In contrast to previous results from the major human pathogen *Aspergillus fumigatus*, isolation of A. flavus from human specimens is associated with population structure, providing a promising system for future investigations into the contributions of population-specific genetic differences to human infection."
