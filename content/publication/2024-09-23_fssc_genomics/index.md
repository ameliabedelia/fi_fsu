abstract: "The *Fusarium solani* species complex are a group of dual-kingdom fungal pathogens capable of causing devastating disease on a wide range of host plants and life-threatening infections in humans that are difficult to treat. In this study, we generate highly contiguous genomes for three clinical isolates of *Fusarium keratoplasticum* and three clinical isolates of *Fusarium petroliphilum* and compare them with other genomes of the FSSC from plant and animal sources. We find that human pathogenicity is polyphyletic within the FSSC, including in *F. keratoplasticum*. Pan-genome analysis revealed a high degree of gene presence-absence in the complex, with only 41% of genes (11,079/27,068) found in all samples and the presence of accessory chromosomes encoding isolate- and species-specific genes. We also defined conserved long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) between *F. keratoplasticum* and *F. petroliphilum*, revealing that they show a similar low degree of presence-absence variation. Secondary metabolite analysis revealed a conserved core set of biosynthetic gene clusters across the FSSC, as well as a unique cluster potentially linked to keratitis. Transcriptomic analysis under stress conditions showed minimal differential gene expression, indicating that both *F. keratoplasticum* and *F. petroliphilum* are well adapted to human infection-relevant conditions. This study provides valuable insights into the evolutionary dynamics, genomic architecture, and potential pathogenicity mechanisms of the FSSC, with implications for understanding multi-kingdom virulence, of increasing relevance as climate change potentially increases the number of fungal species that can grow at human temperatures."
