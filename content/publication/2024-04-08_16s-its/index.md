abstract: "Environmental change is reshaping microbial communities critical to Earth and human health. Loos, Pereira, et al. analyze 1,580 microbiome samples from aquatic, host, and soil biomes to identify characteristics of bacteria and fungi that are resilient to change and identify those that may be vulnerable to biodiversity loss."
