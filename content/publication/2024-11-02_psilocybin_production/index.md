abstract: "The high therapeutic potential of psilocybin, a prodrug of the psychotropic psilocin, holds great promise for the treatment of mental disorders such as therapy-refractory depression, alcohol use disorder and anorexia nervosa. Psilocybin has been designated a ‘Breakthrough Therapy’ by the US Food and Drug Administration, and therefore a sustainable production process must be established to meet future market demands. Here, we present the development of an in vivo psilocybin production chassis based on repression of l-tryptophan catabolism. We demonstrate the proof of principle in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* expressing the psilocybin biosynthetic genes. Deletion of the two aminotransferase genes *ARO8/9* and the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase gene *BNA2* yielded a fivefold increase of psilocybin titre. We transferred this knowledge to the filamentous fungus *Aspergillus nidulans* and identified functional *ARO8/9* orthologs involved in fungal l-tryptophan catabolism by genome mining and cross-complementation. The double deletion mutant of *A. nidulans* resulted in a 10-fold increased psilocybin production. Process optimization based on respiratory activity measurements led to a final psilocybin titre of 267 mg/L in batch cultures with a space–time-yield of 3.7 mg/L/h. These results demonstrate the suitability of our engineered *A. nidulans* to serve as a production strain for psilocybin and other tryptamine-derived pharmaceuticals."
