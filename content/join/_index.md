### BSc and MSc students
We always welcome motivated bachelor and masters students and both lab-based and computational projects are available. If you are interested in doing you BSc or MSc thesis in the group, please send an email containing a short paragraph describing your interest in the group, your goals, and copy of your study transcript(s) (*Leistungs√ºbersicht* in German) to **amelia.barber@uni-jena.de**. 

### PhD, postdoc, and other benefitted positions
We periodically have openings for fully-funded PhD, postdoc, and support staff (e.g. technicians) positions. These are advertised through common academic job portals as well as listed below: 

* **[PhD position in Microbial Pathogens and Climate Change](https://jobs.uni-jena.de/vrbup)**. *Application deadline August 31, 2025.*  
* We anticipate hiring a **postdoc** and a **technician** later in 2025 thanks to incoming funding from the Wellcome Trust. If you are interested in either of these roles, please feel free to get in touch or watch this space for the advertisements.

If you are a prospective PhD student or postdoc interested in applying for a fellowship or with independent funding, please get in touch with your CV and a description of your interest in the group (or potential project ideas!).
