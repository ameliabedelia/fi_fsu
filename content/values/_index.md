**Lab mission statement**.

Our goal is to understand how human pathogenic fungi cause disease and develop antifungal resistance. We love science and embrace the unknown and the thrill of discovery. We work hard and aim to do the best possible science, not necessarily the easiest science. We value scientific and personal integrity, responsibility, openness, creativity, and positivity. We aim to do reproducible and open science. We have a strong mentoring culture, where support and guidance come from both the PI and other group members. Some members work largely in the lab, while others primarily computationally. Regardless of which side we work on, we recognize the immense value of the other and that both are equally important parts of the lab.

We are a diverse group of scientists from around the world with many different backgrounds. We firmly believe that each individual background brings a unique perspective that we welcome. In agreement with these values, we welcome scientists regardless of their race, color, national origin, ethnicity, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, veteran status, marital status, family status, and disability. 

We believe that progress in science is only possible in a society that upholds democracy, human dignity, and a welcoming environment for all. Therefore, we support the [Weltoffenes Th√ºringen](https://www.thueringen-weltoffen.de/) initiative.
