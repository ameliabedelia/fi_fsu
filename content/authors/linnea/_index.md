Linnéa completed her masters thesis research in the group as a visiting researcher from Uppsala University. During her time in the group she worked on the phenotypic characterization of *Aspergillus* cryptic species. Her plan for the immediate future is to return to the biotech company where she worked prior to completing her MSc.
