Marion Perrier is a PhD student working with the pan-genome and transcriptome of *Aspergillus fumigatus*, with a deeper focus on its pathogenicity and antifungal resistance. Coming from France, she obtained her BSc in biochemistry, molecular biology and microbiology in 2018, and graduated in 2020 with a bioinformatics MSc in the south of France. Then, she worked as a bioinformatician engineer at the Toulouse cancer research centre for two years, where she mainly analysed various transcriptomics data and developed a new single-cell visualisation tool. Outside of the lab, she enjoys roller skating, playing musical instruments, a board games evening with friends, and occasionally reading about exobiology.
