Laura is a postdoc with a background in virology who has done research in her native Argentina and Italy before coming to Germany. During her PhD studies, she developed a strong interest in bioinformatics and its application in understanding human diseases. During her postdoctoral training at the University of La Plata in Argentina, she focused on long non-coding RNA in cancer.  

In the Barber lab, Laura is studying the involvement of fungal long non-coding RNA in antifungal resistance. Laura is the recipient of a fellowship for female postdoctoral researchers, funded by the Free State of Thuringia. 

Beyond her scientific pursuits, Laura finds immense joy and fulfillment in spending quality time with her daughter. In addition, she enjoys reading and cooking.
