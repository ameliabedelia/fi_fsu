The migratory Phillip Brassington completed his doctoral thesis research on comparative genomics in *Candida parapsilosis* and the *Fusarium solani* species complex and is currently awaiting his oral defense. 

His publications from the group can be found [here](https://barber-lab.com/author/phillip-jt-brassington/).

Native to New Zealand, he completed his biological bachelor's in California, and his biomedical master's in northern Germany. Between degrees, he spent two years at Hammersmith Medicines Research in London as a clinical studies and laboratory technician. When not at work, he is usually found reading, hiking, dabbling in storytelling, hobby coding, or occasionally enjoying a night with friends.
