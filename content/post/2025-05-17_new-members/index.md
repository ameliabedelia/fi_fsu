The group is excited to welcome three new members: postdoc Fabio, BSc thesis student Philipp, and postdoc Yuanyuan. 

On the other side, we are sad to see Linnea's time in the group for her MSc thesis come to an end and for Phillip to have submitted his dissertation and moved out of Germany

The group commemorated this with a trip to Jena's Spring Festival (pictured above).
