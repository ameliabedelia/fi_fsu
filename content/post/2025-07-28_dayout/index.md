Continuing our tradition from past years, the group did a joint day out with the [Blango](https://blangolab.com/) and [Janevska](https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/epi-genetic-regulation-of-fungal-virulence.html) groups from the Leibniz-HKI. We even had a special guest for the day: [Prof. Matt Mulvey](https://www.bioscience.utah.edu/faculty/mulvey/index.php) (University of Utah) was visiting Jena and joined us for our day out. 

This year's day out took us to outside Weimar and featured a visit to [Schloss Ettersburg](https://schlossettersburg.de/) and a scavenger hunt (Schnitzeljagd) around the palace and the surrounding Rautenschlag nature preserve. 

Thanks particularly to Michael and Fabio for their work in organizing the day out!
