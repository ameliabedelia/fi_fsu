Amelia is excited and deeply honoured to be selected as CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholar. She joins a select group of early-career researchers from around the world who are recognized for their outstanding scientific contributions and strong potential for interdisciplinary collaboration.

In addition to unrestricted research support to pursue high risk/high reward projects, the program helps junior faculty deepen and broaden their professional network and strengthen leadership skills.

"The Scholars will each join a CIFAR research program where they will participate as equal members within an international and interdisciplinary network of some of the world’s leading researchers, who are pursuing a fundamental research question together." - [CIFAR](https://cifar.ca/next-generation/global-scholars/)
