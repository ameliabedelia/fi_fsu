Our team gathered for a two-day retreat in the [Hainich National Park](https://www.nationalpark-hainich.de/de/index.html). 
Group members summarized their achievements over the past year and led project workshops brainstorming ideas for ongoing work.

We also discussed several science-adjacent topics, including where to find funding and the basics of grant writing, time management and working efficiently, and building a personal brand as a scientist.
We also brought back a favorite from last year and drew graphical abstracts based on another lab members' presentations (top picture above). 

But it wasn't all work! We also got to explore the area, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site, through hiking and climbing into the venue's tree house.

We also got to know each others interests outside the lab, including detecting exoplanets, the art of Argentinian Mate, and earning rewards on everyday purchases. 

Finally, no Barber Lab retreat is complete without several rounds of competitive Uno using Ailton's modifications that keep you on your toes and reacting quickly!

We are all already looking forward to next year's retreat!
