*Candida parapsilosis* is emerging as a growing threat for hospitalized patients. In our study, we investigated an outbreak of multi-drug resistant hospital-acquired infections of this fungus and developed a new molecular detection method that can quickly and cost-effectively differentiate strains of *C. parapsilosis*. 

The study was published in *The Lancet Microbe*, with leading contributions by PhD student Phillip, and great collaboration with the NRZMyk (h/t Grit Walther) and experts from the Paulinen Hospital and diagnostic laboratories in Berlin.
