Our team gathered for our annual two-day scientific retreat, this time in the city of Eisenach. 

Group members summarized their achievements over the past year and led project workshops brainstorming ideas for ongoing work.

We also discussed several science-adjacent topics, including overcoming imposter syndrome, role models and mentors and their impact on us, career planning, and tips and tricks for making and presenting posters.

We also brought back a lab retreat tradition and drew graphical abstracts based on another lab members' presentations at the retreat (above). 

But it wasn't all science! In our free time we went walking and admired the view of the historic Wartburg Castle, where Martin Luther hid in exile. We also got to know each others interests outside the lab, including learning about the history and types of Swiss Fondue and a competitive quiz to see who was the best at guessing the meaning of French language idioms. 

We also all enjoyed playing the game **[Mycology](https://www.bioprospectus.com/)** and filling our foraging baskets with mushrooms, while avoiding collecting too many poisonous fungi.

Truly a highlight of the year. Can't wait for the next one!
