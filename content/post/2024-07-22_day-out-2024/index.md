For our summer day out we joined forces with the [Blango](https://blangolab.com/) and [Janevska](https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/epi-genetic-regulation-of-fungal-virulence.html) groups for a day at the [Camburg Archery Parcour](http://camburger-bogenschuetzen.de/?page_id=229) :bow_and_arrow:.

In addition to being excellent researchers, some group members had natural talents for archery! :dart:

Others, like Amelia, are lucky they have other talents to keep them employed!
